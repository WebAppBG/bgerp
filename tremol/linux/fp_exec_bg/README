System software for Tremol Fiscal Printer / ECR
-----------------------------------------------

Introduction
============
The system software for Tremol fiscal devices includes two modules: fp_exec and fp_server. Fp_exec is
console program which controls the fiscal device and interprets commands stored in XML file. The result
is returned as process exit code and optionally in XML output file. Fp_server is GUI for fp_exec. It
gets XML command file from its incoming folder, runs fp_exec to process the file, and displays a log of
operations. The POS software can use fp_exec directly or store the XML commands in fp_server's incoming
folder. To setup and fiscalize the fiscal device you have to use RegFU from Windowssoftware pack.
Fp_exec uses TinyXML library to parse XML files.


System Requirements
===================
Linux, GTK+, USB or serial port


Installation
============
Extract the files from archive. File fp_exec.conf must be accessible for reading and writing by fp_exec.
"Port" entry contains the file name of serial or USB port used by the fiscal device.


Format of fp_exec.conf
======================
The file fp_exec.conf contains configurable parameters for fp_exec and fp_server. Multiple fiscal devices
or different profiles for single device are supported. The parameters are divided into separate sections
enclosed in square brackets similarly to Windows .INI files. The default section is "TremolFP". To select
different section, use "-d" or "--device_name" command line option for fp_exec. Fp_server global settings
are stored in [fp_server] or in "GUI_..." keys for each device name.
